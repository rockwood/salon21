        Salon 21 is a series of intimate piano concerts in unexpected places around the city. They’re modeled after 19th century salons, where famous musicians and composers performed in people’s living rooms. Salon 21 updates these historic salons for the 21st century. Imagine an evening filled with wine, food, friends, world-class music and exciting new ideas.
